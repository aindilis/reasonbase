 Enju is an implementation of a parsing algorithm for probabilistic
 unification-based grammars. With a wide-coverage probabilistic HPSG
 grammar [1,2,3] and an efficient parsing algorithm [4,5], this parser
 can effectively analyze the syntactic/semantic structure of an
 English sentence and provide the user with predicate-argument
 relations among the words. Those outputs would be especially useful
 for high-level NLP applications including information extraction,
 automatic summarization, and question answering, where the "meaning"
 of a sentence plays a central role. The main features of the parser
 are the following:
 .
 + Includes a wide-coverage HPSG grammar and its probabilistic model
   (for details see this page).
 + Uses an efficient parsing algorithm.
 + Allows the user to customize the grammar.
 + Accepts raw texts as well as tokenized texts with part-of-speech
   tags.
